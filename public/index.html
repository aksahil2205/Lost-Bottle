            <p>I really used to love talking and connecting with random strangers on the internet and found it a healthy way to share each other cultures. It's just wild to me that people on the different sides of the globe who share the same interest can just become friends. I really loved this concept. Also I saw a confession video, where people anonmoyously confess their secrets on a mic in streets or wrote it on a paper and left. It seemed like a nice way to get some weight off the chest so I thought to make a website on it. Hence I created this site where people can just leave messages for one another and share their secrets, thoughts, experiences and what not. Also huge shoutout to Omegle(RIP) for inspiring me to make this site </p>
